## Random Forest

run the `.ipynb` directly in the RandomForest folder, cell-by-cell, and all the parameters are in their best setting already.

To generate output, simply run the last cell of that file.



## SVM

run the `.ipynb` directly in the SVM folder, cell-by-cell, and all the parameters are in their best setting already.

To generate output, simply run the last cell of that file.



## Stacking

run the following code in your cmd line

```shell
python base_whole_model0.py
python base_whole_model1.py
python base_whole_model2.py
```

And you can get the result of the corresponding model showing in your terminal. And you can find the best model save in the folder `./Stacking/models` .

To generate output, change the model name to the one you want and also check the work direction. then run the following line in your terminal

```shell
python generate_test_result.py
```

## Neural Network

run the following code in your cmd line

```shell
python data_tech_nn.py
python naive_nn.py
python grid_nn.py
```

And you can get the result of the corresponding model showing in your terminal. And you can find the best model save in the folder `./NeuralNetwork` .

To generate output, change the model name to the one you want and also check the work direction. then run the following line in your terminal

```shell
python generate_test_result.py
```
